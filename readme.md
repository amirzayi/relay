# USAGE
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure application has privilege to connect to network and change filesystem.

> [!TIP]
> If you increase the size of read/write buffer. Operating system can touch the I/O device less. And it can read/write larger blocks in each operation. Set buffer size on powers of two with non-negative exponents to achieve more performance and speed.

> [!NOTE]
> Timeout flag receives s, m and h in given timeout format which are Second, Minute And Hour. For example: 72h3m0.5s is 72Hours and 3 Minutes and 0.5 Second.

send command must have at least 1 argument which has file or directory path
```
relay send [-p 12345 | -i 127.0.0.1 | -b 1024 | -t 120s | -w 25 | -l false] some_file.ext other_file2.ext some_directory_within_subdirectories
```

### Flags
```
-s, --save string   files save path (default "/home/$(USER)/relay")
```

## Connect to the host to receive files
```
relay receive -i 127.0.0.1 [-p 12345 | -b 1024 | -t 120s | -w 25 | -s /home | -l false]
```
